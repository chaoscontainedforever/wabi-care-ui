Introduction
The Watson Institute’s L.I.F.E Curriculum (Life Skills: Integrating Functional Activities and Everyday Experiences) is a comprehensive, standards based curriculum guide for developing functional skills for students with moderate to severe disabilities. The L.I.F.E. Curriculum is intended to provide a structure and format from which professionals can expand current instructional goals and objectives, design further learning activities, and continue to work toward functional skills for students with moderate to severe disabilities.
In special education, a primary focus is to help students with disabilities lead successful, independent and fulfilling lives.  A functional curriculum is designed to prepare students to function as independently as possible in a community setting (Ford, Davern, & Schnorr, 2001).  A broad range of skills must be included in the design of a functional curriculum appropriate for students with disabilities.
In working with students with more severe disabilities, it has been challenging to find a curriculum that addresses the functional skills needed for this population.  Many curriculums for students with disabilities are those that have been adapted from a regular curriculum.  In looking for and not finding such a curriculum, the Core Curriculum Committee was born at The Education Center at The Watson Institute.  
This process began with guidance from Susan Gove, Ph.D., founder of Gove Group, Inc. and a selection of staff to be part of this project.  The core members reviewed a number of life skills curriculums and also did research in this area.  In reviewing the literature, a set of materials found to be a great resource was A Functional Assessment and Curriculum for Teaching Students with Disabilities, Valletutti, Bender and Baglin, 2008.  This four volume set includes  Volume 1:Self –Care, Motor Skills, Household Management, and Living Skills, Volume 2:Nonverbal Communication, Oral Communication and Literacy Preparation, Volume 3: Functional Academics, and Volume 4: Interpersonal, Competitive Job-Finding, and Leisure-Time Skill. The L.I.F.E. Curriculum addresses functional life skills across these domains.
The above volumes cite Gast and Schuster (1993) and the principles that they outlined as ones to observe in the development and implementation of a functional curriculum.  The Core Curriculum Committee at the Education Center at The Watson Institute believed that the instructor/designer should:
Focus on teaching skills that are chronologically age-appropriate and immediately useful to the learner. 
Use ecological inventories and compile a community catalog and future environments that are important to the students. 
Define goals based on the prior step.  
Prioritize goals based on their potential for enhancing independence.
Task analyze the skills needed to perform successfully.  
Conduct a discrepancy analysis to determine what students can and cannot do. 
Use principles of applied behavior analysis.  
Provide instruction in integrated and community settings. (p. 471)
When designing The Education Center’s Curriculum, the team took into account the need for it to be standards based as well, but in a broader sense.  In reviewing the Pennsylvania State Standards and the Pennsylvania Alternate Content Standards in some areas, the team listed the standards that related to each domain and sub-domain.  
In reviewing the various curriculums, the Functional Skills Curricular Framework, from Ventura County, California, was one that all members agreed had the format, as well as the direction, for The Watson Institute’s L.I.F.E Curriculum.
The Watson Institute’s L.I.F.E Curriculum is one that supports the needs of the students with significant disabilities and prepares them to be successfully included in the school and the community.  It provides support for educational programs that need to be modified in functional real-life ways.  In essence, life is the curriculum (Baglin, Bender and Valletutti, 2008).
About the Watson Institute
The Watson Institute is an approved private school, Pennsylvania state academic standards are referenced accordingly based on the population served at the Watson Institute.
The Watson Institute was established in 1917 as the D.T. Watson Home for Crippled Children and has been meeting the educational and medical needs of children with disabilities for more than 80 years.
Founders of the institute, David and Margaret Watson, envisioned a place where children could be cared for and encouraged to succeed. That vision continues to inspire us as we look for new ways to improve the lives of children with disabilities. Today, The Watson Institute helps children with disabilities achieve their fullest potential in all aspects of their lives.
The Watson Institute offers a continuum of services for children with autism, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, neurological impairments, developmental delays, brain injuries, severe emotional and behavioral challenges, and other impairments as well as the professionals who work with them. Watson provides special education and other programs and services that meet the physical, emotional, cognitive and social needs of the whole child. These programs and services develop competence, promote well being and foster interpersonal relationships and community connections.
One of The Watson Institute’s goals is to prepare children to move on to less restrictive settings whenever possible by developing their cognitive, social and behavioral skills. During this time we recognize the importance of providing support and education to families, which we accomplish through a variety of services including transition planning, family skills training, support groups and respite care.

How to Use this Curriculum
Overview
This curriculum is meant to be a guide for planning, instructing, and assessing life skills. 
The skills included in this curriculum are derived from the Pennsylvania Academic Standards. The standards for school-age and early childhood are referenced. Skills which are meaningful and appropriate for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities have been included. For each sub domain in the curriculum, standards to which the skills are referenced will be found in the column to the left. 
The number of skills addressed for each age group increases. However, knowing the population for which this curriculum was developed, skills are progressive. Therefore, early skills are carried over into each age group. It is recommended that users consider age appropriate materials even when working on below age-level skills. 
Since it was developed for use with students with moderate to severe disabilities, all skills may be addressed in structured settings. Students may need prompts to experience and practice certain skills. While independence when appropriate is the ultimate goal, it is assumed that individuals will require varying degrees of prompting including, but not limited to, gestural cues, visual cues, auditory cues, structuring of the environment, physical guidance, tactile prompts, hand-over-hand, modeling.
Skill checklists are provided with each domain to assist in assessing the skills and documenting the level of prompting necessary. Using the skills checklists may provide information as to an individual’s general areas of strength and weakness, and may help to guide instruction.

Multiple levels of prompts may be necessary for a student to complete the task. Use the comment section to add notes about what type of prompts were necessary for the student to complete the task. Printing a complete set of skills checklists and creating individual student binders may be an efficient way for teachers and therapists to see which skills need more attention and monitor progress.
